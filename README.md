# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection
Developed a real-time vehicle number plate detection system using a webcam feed. Implemented image preprocessing 
techniques including grayscale conversion, edge detection, and contour analysis to locate rectangular license plates. 
Integrated Easy OCR for automatic recognition of text from detected license plates. Applied OpenCV for live video 
capture, image segmentation, and annotation of recognized plates.
